# HiveWatch

## Overview
An AI-powered monitoring and detection system for identifying bees, wasps, and potential threats to beehives. HiveWatch uses computer vision and machine learning to help beekeepers monitor hive activity, detect threats, and maintain healthy colonies through automated visual inspection.

## Purpose
To provide beekeepers with an intelligent monitoring solution that can automatically identify and differentiate between beneficial bees and harmful insects. The system aims to reduce manual inspection time while improving hive protection and management.

### Key Objectives:
- Automated detection of bees, wasps, and other hive threats
- Accurate species differentiation for threat assessment

## Scope

### Technology Stack:
- **Deep Learning**: YOLO11x (You Only Look Once) object detection
- **Programming**: Python 3.9.20
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
