# Model Evaluation

This folder provides end-to-end post-training analysis for YOLO models, including:

- Visualization of training/validation loss and F1 trends  
- Inference-based evaluation on held-out data (class distributions, object-size statistics, error-type and IoU breakdowns)  
- Production of confusion matrices, precisionâ€“recall curves and a consolidated JSON report of precision, recall and F1
